To test my test case by using the comment below.

make error1

make error1x

make error2

make error2x

make error3

make error3x

    make error4
    
    make error4x
    
    make error5
    
    make error5x
    
    make arrays
    
    make arraysx
    
    make conditionals
    
    make conditionalsx
    
    make recursion
    
    make recursionx
    make iteration
    make iterationx
    make functions
    make functionsx      # shows you can pass functions and return nested functions
    make lambda      
    make lambdax      
    make objects      
    make objectsx        # get and update field, method call (e.g. setter)

  Because my wrong direction, finally rewrite, but some feature like read file can't work properly, but everything else is fine. 

  My grammar of the language has been revised several time because of the unfamiliar of the concept of programming languages.
  Now this language is very similar to javascript without the "var" definition

  I also have 3 pretty print test case. 
  
  make prettyPrint1
  make prettyPrint2
  make prettyPrint3

  I have a .sh file called run.sh
  run.sh can run the problem.stc file.

  Because of my heavy schedule with 4 400+ level CS class I am not able to make the read file and objects work. And I even don't have time to go to office hour.
